# endevouros-bumbleble-status
Endevouros is really a awesome distro. I totally liked it. But one thing make me upset is the i3 status bar. I don't like the status bar as the provide. Don't have battery status and not looks so beautiful.

So i have installed bumblebee-status bar. It's beautiful and pre-modified. I have uploaded my config file. So you can easily install it.
All you have to do go to the bumblebee website https://bumblebee-status.readthedocs.io/ and follow the installation medthod. and change my config file with your config file.
I3wm config file are located in ~/.config/i3/config
